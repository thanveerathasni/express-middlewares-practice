A structured and practical repository to **master Express.js middleware**  
using **real-world patterns**, **runnable examples**, and **clear documentation**.

This repository is focused on **backend fundamentals and production readiness**,  
not demo or CRUD-style examples.

---

## Overview

This repository is built to deeply understand how middleware works in Express.js,
covering **security, authentication, performance, observability, and architecture**.

Each middleware concept is implemented with:
- Reusable middleware logic
- Isolated runnable examples
- Dedicated notes for revision and interviews

---

## What This Repository Covers

### Authentication & Authorization
- Authentication middleware
- JWT authentication
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Security Middlewares
- Request validation (Zod)
- Input sanitization
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Cache-control
- Rate limiting

### Stability & Performance
- Request timeout middleware
- Compression
- Helmet security headers

### Observability & Monitoring
- Request ID tracking
- Metrics (response time & status)
- Audit logging (user action tracking)

### Middleware Patterns & Architecture
- Application-level middleware
- Route-level middleware
- Router-level middleware
- Error-handling middleware
- Async error handling pattern
- Production-ready Express architecture

Each topic follows a strict structure:

**One middleware → One example → One note**

---

## Why This Repository Exists

To build strong Express fundamentals

To understand real middleware use cases

To maintain a revision-ready reference

To prepare for backend interviews

To apply these patterns directly in MERN projects

## Best Way to Use This Repo

Use notes/ for theory and quick revision

Run files inside examples/ to understand behavior

Reuse middlewares/ directly in real projects

Review before interviews to refresh concepts


## Real-world use cases

This repository is structured to support that explanation.
