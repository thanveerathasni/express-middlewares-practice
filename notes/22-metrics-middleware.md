# Metrics Middleware

## What is metrics middleware?
Metrics middleware measures request performance
such as response time and status code.

## Why use it?
- Identify slow APIs
- Monitor server health
- Improve performance

## How it works?
- Capture start time
- Calculate duration after response
- Log metrics data

## Where it is used?
- Production APIs
- Monitoring systems
- Performance dashboards

## Important points
- Should not block request
- Runs after response finishes
- Often combined with request ID

## Interview one-liner
Metrics middleware tracks request
performance for monitoring and optimization.
